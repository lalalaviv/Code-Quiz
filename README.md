## Code Quiz

This is a timed code quiz which runs on a browser and consists of multiple choice questions about coding. The user will be given 75 seconds to complete all questions, where time will be deducted if wrong answers are given, and the game will end either when the time runs out or when all questions have been answered. The user will also be able to save their scores and initials after each challenge, which will display in the score chart.
